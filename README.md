# ds4e extras

This a companion repo to https://github.com/grantmcdermott/ds4e.

Mostly, we are using it to host HTML widgets and other things that are 
complicated/time-consuming to build via CI...which is what we use to 
automatically render the online version of the 
[DS4E book](https://grantmcdermott.com/ds4e/).
